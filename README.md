# REST League

### 🏆 REST API Black-Box Testing Tool Competition

Welcome to **REST League**, the ultimate competition for automated black-box testing tools designed for **RESTful APIs**.

The goal of REST League is to evaluate the performance of open-source and proprietary tools in finding bugs, security vulnerabilities, and logic flaws in real-world REST APIs without access to their source code.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Participants submit their automated **black-box** testing tools to compete against a benchmark set of **REST APIs**. These APIs contain a variety of intentionally injected issues, ranging from functional defects to common security flaws.

> What is **black-box** testing?
>
> In this context, black-box testing means the tools interact with an API solely via its public endpoints, documented by an **OpenAPI specification**. Tools **generate test cases** by leveraging the specification and the feedback from the API, without looking at the API's internal inomplementation.

### 🛠️ Tool Requirements

Tools must meet the following general requirements to participate

* **Automation:** The core testing process must be fully automated and reproducible
* **Black-box:** Must operate strictly without access to the API's source code
* **Target:** Must be explicitly designed to test REST APIs
* **Containerized:** Submissions must be easily deployable, via a Docker image

In particular, the tools must be compatible with [RESTgym](https://github.com/SeUniVr/RESTgym), a benchmarking infrastructure specifically designed for REST API testing tools.

### 📊 Evaluation Criteria

Tools will be scored based on a comprehensive set of criteria, focusing on both **quality of testing** and **resource efficiency**

1. **Fault Detection:** The total number of *unique* `5XX` responses obtained by the tool
2. **Operation Coverage:** The extent of API endpoints succesfully tested (obtaining a `2XX` response)
3. **Code Coverage:** The extend of API code effectively explored during testing (measuread in terms of methods, statements, and branches covered)
4. **Testing Efficiency:** The time taken and the number of requests needed to achieve the fault and coverage results

The final score will be a weighted aggregate of these metrics. Testing metrics will be collected by using the [RESTats](https://github.com/SeUniVr/restats) tool.

## 💡 How to Participate

1. **Register:** Fill out the [**Registration Form**](https://www.google.com) to officially enter your tool
2. **Prepare:** Ensure your tool meets all requirements and is ready for deployment
3. **Submit:** Provide access to your tool, along with detailed setup and execution instructions

> **Sandboxed Execution:** All submitted tools will be run in a secure, isolated, and controlled environment by REST League organizers. Details of the machine running the experiments will be provided upon registration.

### 🗓️ Competition Timeline

REST League will be hosted by [SBFT@ICSE2026](https://search-based-and-fuzz-testing.github.io/sbft26) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the following schedule.

### 🏆 Awards & Recognition

* **🥇 Gold API Tester:** Highest overall score and ultimate champion
* **🥈 Silver API Tester:** Second-highest overall score
* **⭐ Bug Hunter Award:** For the tool with the highest number of unique `5XX` found
